# Simple Calculator Application

## Changes Made:
1. The `InputConverter` class is now static.
2. The program asks for the input again if the user enters invalid numbers or operations.
3. The result is shown in a readable format with two decimal places (e.g., 10.10).
4. The `CalculatorEngine` class was moved to a separate project as a DLL.
5. A new function was added to calculate the power of a number.

## How to Use:
1. Enter two numbers when asked.
2. Enter an operation (e.g., +, -, *, /, ^).
3. The result will be shown in a readable format.
